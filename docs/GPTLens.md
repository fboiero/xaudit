### GPTLens

GPTLENS is an innovative framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for intelligent detection of vulnerabilities in smart contracts. This framework operates in two stages: Auditor and Critic.

In the Auditor stage, an LLM scans the smart contract code to identify potential vulnerabilities. It utilizes contextual capabilities to detect patterns or constructs associated with vulnerabilities.

In the Critic stage, another LLM evaluates the Auditor's findings to determine whether the identified vulnerabilities are genuine or false positives. This involves a deeper analysis of the code's context and logic.

The uniqueness of GPTLENS lies in its two-stage approach, which reduces false positives and maximizes the detection of real vulnerabilities. This is achieved by filtering the Auditor's results through the Critic.

GPTLENS offers several advantages, such as more precise and reliable detection of vulnerabilities, efficiency in processing complex code, adaptability to new types of vulnerabilities and contract structures, and the ability to understand the context and semantics of smart contract code.
