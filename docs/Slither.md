### Slither

Slither is an open-source static code analysis framework for Solidity and Vyper, written in Python3. Its aim is to provide valuable insights into Ethereum smart contracts. It offers automated vulnerability detection, code optimization suggestions, improved code understanding, and assistance in code review. Slither works by converting Solidity contracts into an intermediate representation called SlithIR, which facilitates analysis implementation while preserving semantic information. Slither runs a set of predefined analyses in various stages, from information retrieval to vulnerability detection and code optimizations. Additionally, it provides an API for writing custom analyses in Python. It is easy to integrate into development workflows, has a low false positive rate, and supports Solidity and Vyper, offering fast runtime and high accuracy in its analyses.
