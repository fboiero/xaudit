### LLama2


LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) is a large language model (LLM) released by Meta AI in February 2023. This model stands out for its architecture based on transformers and was trained with a focus on increasing the volume of training data rather than simply increasing the number of parameters. This approach allowed LLaMA to achieve outstanding performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, even surpassing much larger models like GPT-3 on certain benchmarks.

The LLaMA model was trained on a massive dataset of 1.4 trillion tokens, obtained from various public sources such as web pages crawled by CommonCrawl, open-source code repositories on GitHub, Wikipedia in multiple languages, public domain books from Project Gutenberg, among others. This wide diversity of data contributed to the versatility and quality of the model.

Although initially released for research under a non-commercial license, LLaMA data was leaked to the general public shortly after its release. This elicited various reactions, from concerns about potential malicious uses to celebrations over the model's accessibility to promote further research development.

The code used to train the model was made public under the open-source GPL 3 license, and efforts were made to reproduce and distribute an open-source version of the LLaMA dataset. Additionally, training programs based on LLaMA, such as Alpaca, have been developed, which uses the "Self-training" fine-tuning method to acquire capabilities comparable to models like OpenAI's GPT-3, but at a more modest cost.
