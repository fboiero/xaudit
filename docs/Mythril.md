### Mythril

Mythril is an open-source smart contract security analyzer that utilizes symbolic execution to detect a wide range of vulnerabilities. It is compatible with various blockchains such as Ethereum, Hedera, Quorum, Vechain, Roostock, Tron, among others. This analyzer combines static analysis and symbolic execution to detect vulnerabilities such as timestamp dependency, arbitrary address writing, and integer overflow. It integrates with the MythX security analysis platform, which offers static analysis, symbolic execution, and input fuzzing to detect security flaws and verify the correctness of smart contract code. MythX uses tools like Maru for static analysis and Harvey for greybox fuzzing. Additionally, Mythril provides symbolic execution and SMT resolution to detect vulnerabilities by representing program states and control flow. Finally, Mythril undergoes a correlation and communication process between tools to ensure accurate and understandable results for the user.
